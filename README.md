# Project1
My final project for the first year of NMCT

It's called the Sensonizer. It's an syntesizer based on sensors.
 # The structure
    An Arduino Leonardo reads a presure sensor and a position sensor values. And transforms these analog
    values to midi note on signals ( is used the MIDIUSB library)
    
    I used an Raspberry Pi to run:
      - Python flask webserver
      - MardiaDB database     
      - Fluidsynth synthesizer
      - Apache2 hhtp server
